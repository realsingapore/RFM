Goal:-
The goal of this initiative is to develop an Advanced FNOL Claims Intelligence System capable of delivering highly accurate Ultimate Claim Cost predictions from the moment a claim is reported. This system not only predicts the financial impact of each claim but also retrains itself automatically using new, user-uploaded datasets, ensuring the model stays aligned with evolving claim patterns. At the backend, the platform incorporates SHAP and LIME for deep, transparent explainability allowing claims handlers, auditors, and regulators to understand why a prediction was made. The entire ecosystem, from preprocessing to prediction to retraining, is deployed on Hugging Face, making it fully accessible, interactive, and scalable for enterprise-level use.


Industry relevance:-
Within the UK motor insurance sector, insurers like Admiral are facing increasing pressures due to rising claim frequencies, complex repair supply chains, the emergence of electric vehicles, and more sophisticated fraud attempts. Customers now expect faster, clearer, and more reliable settlement processes, putting additional pressure on claims operations. As a result, insurers are rapidly adopting ML-driven automation to enhance FNOL accuracy, reduce operational delays, and strengthen financial planning. An intelligent, continuously learning FNOL system directly responds to these industry needs, improving both internal efficiency and customer outcomes.
